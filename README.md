  - Input text controls what the computer says
  - If input text contains "https" the script will assume it's a youtube link, and open it
  - Time interval controls the minimum amount of time between noises, in seconds
  - If random is set to "y" it will add a random amount of time to the minimum time interval
  - If on is set to "y" it will make noises, if it's set to "n" it won't
